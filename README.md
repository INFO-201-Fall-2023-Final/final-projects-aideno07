Minimum Wage in Comparison to Inflation Rates
Our final project discusses the alarming increase with inflation rates over the last 20 years in accordance with minimum wage rates. With job wages not being properly adjusted to accommodate these changes, many citizens find themselves struggling with financial disparities and an increase in poverty rates become unavoidable. Through the datasets we have found, we are able to see that minimum wage has been increasing with the rates of inflation. Though when the wage is compared and adjusted to how much inflation has risen, the wage growth is minimal or even none. As this is a prevalent issue that has been occurring for years and more to come, we found that this would be an important topic to present.
