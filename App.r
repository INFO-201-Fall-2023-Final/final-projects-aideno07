                    Soaring costs of living, coupled with stagnant wages, make it increasingly challenging to maintain financial stability, pushing individuals into a cycle of economic despair. 
                    The widening wage gap exacerbates poverty rates, a persistent issue in the US. As savings are depleted, unemployment rises, and social unrest grows, poverty and homelessness surge. 
                    The struggle for daily needs intensifies, impacting mental well-being, while businesses suffer from adjusting prices amid financial hardships. Despite acknowledging the issue, 
                    the US faces difficulties in finding effective solutions, raising the question: How much must the minimum wage increase to keep pace with inflation?"),
